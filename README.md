Hello

This is the app to create bitmap animations as seen in the YouTube video down below.

Simple instructions:
1. Choose a color, click with RMB on selected pixel or swipe through group of pixels with RMB on. But beware! If you swipe out of the pixel board, the color will be released.
2. Add next frames by clicking proper button in the buttons menu.
3. See your animation in animation module, you can also change the time interval and edit frame you paused your animation on!
4. Have fun!

Some development tips:
1. To install just clone the app and run npm install
2. To run: npm start
3. Linting scripts: npm run lint, npm run lint-debug.
4. There are also some test: npm run test.
